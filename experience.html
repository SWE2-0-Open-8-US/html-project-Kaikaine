          <p>Chicago (and surrounding Chicagoland area)</p>
          <p>
            Lived here a majority of my life. Food here was definitely top tier
            but there was one place in the suburbs that had the best chicken
            I've had in my entire life and no other place I've been to has been
            like it. Lots of events and the people are ok. Like a mix of NYC
            rudeness and southern hospitality. There's also this one guy who
            stands outside a stadium and just condems peple all day who has his
            own wiki page so that's something. 8/10
          </p>

          <!-- <div class="dmv"> -->
          <p>DMV</p>
          <p>
            The DMV, mainly Nothern Virginia, was interesting. First of all, the
            public transit there was immmaculate in my opinion. Chicago's was
            good but something about the effiency of the transit in DMV was very
            satisfying to me. The wealth disparity was also a lot more apparent.
            It was either luxury living or not so great living conditions.
            Didn't see much of anything in the middle. The food was good.
            Nothing crazy memborable about the food other than the seafood
            tasting fresher. Skipped out on the dmv brunch scene so that's going
            to skew this review a bit too. Overall, 7/10 BUT I do think if I go
            back and experience it now it'll be an 8 or 9 out of 10 just because
            the weather there was solid. Never too cold or too hot.

          <p>Cincinnati</p>
          <p>
            Errrrmmmmmm Cincinnati Ohio felt like a fever dream to me. There was
            this faint smell of pee in the downtown area no matter where I went
            and it was relatively dirty compared to its size. They had this free
            trolley that went around the city so that was a plus. Food was just
            normal. They're apparently known for their chili but I've had canned
            chili better than their famous stuff. Would I go back here? No. The
            only positive thing I can think of is that it's a cheaper place to
            live in and the traffic was never crazy. 5/10

          <p>Springfield Illinois</p>
          <p>
            3/10. Felt like very little changed about the town since Abe Lincoln
            died. It was like stepping back in time and not in a good way. It's
            a small town so i wasn't expecting much and even then I was still
            disappointed.

          <p>Tulsa OK</p>
          <p>
            Tulsa OK has been well, ok. They're trying to give this little city
            a big city feel but it's just not possible. The Arkansas river is
            more mud than water half the time. Weather isn't terrible but I'm
            not a fan of it either. No tornadoes so far. And the people here are
            weird. Like, multiple times when I was buying something from the
            store, the cashier would ask if I'm from here because I don't have
            that weird tulsa aura. They're trying to get this city right and I
            feel like it may be someone's cup of tea but for me? I'm not
            drinking out of that cup. 6/10
